          <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              Artists involved in the 1980s art scene found it hard to find affordable loft space 
              in Manhattan, so they chose to move to Gowanus. Gowanus' industrial lofts were like 
              those in SoHo, but much more affordable for these people. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Salvatore Scotto, a community advocate, promoted Gowanus to developers and potential 
              residents, who became interested in the area, by holding neighborhood tours. He networked 
              with developers, who would renovate vacant properties for profit. These new apartments 
              were advertised to wealthy Manhattan residents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lifelong Gowanus residents didn't trust Scotto. They argued that Scotto's “marketing” of 
              the neighborhood was causing the gentrification that pushed lifelong residents out of their 
              homes. Celia Cacace, Scotto's most vocal critic at the time, stated, "I don't call it 
              gentrification, I call it genocide because they're killing off neighborhoods."
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2008, a real estate development company, the Toll Brothers, proposed a plan to build 
              luxury apartment complexes next to the canal, even though it's not safe for people to live 
              there. The Toll Brothers believed that the development would "spur the cleanup" of the canal 
              thanks to the incoming wealthy condo buyers. Toll Brothers abandoned the plan in 
              2010, after the Gowanus Canal was declared a Superfund site.

          <h3>Green Gentrification</h3>
            <h4>What is greening?</h4>
              <p>Greening is:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The process of becoming more active about protecting the environment</li>
                  <li>The process of making somewhere greener by planting grass, trees, and plants there</li>
                  <li>The process of beginning to pay attention to the protection of the natural environment</li>
                </ul>
              <p>
                Greening is used to improve neighborhoods where low-income people and people of color live by 
                creating or restoring environmental amenities such as parks. However, greening can also attract 
                wealthier and/or white residents, who push out lower-income and minority residents. 
              </p>
            <h4>Who benefits from greening?</h4>
              <p>
                In the end, the people who get to enjoy these green changes the most are the new wealthier 
                residents, who also tend to be in positions of greater power.
              </p>
            <h4>How is greening related to gentrification?</h4>
              <p>
                The negative result of greening, which leads to the exclusion and displacement of politically 
                disenfranchised residents, is recognized as a form of gentrification known as green gentrification.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just as how greening can lead to gentrification, gentrification in an area can also lead to greening.

          <h3>Gentrification</h3>
            <h4>What is happening in Gowanus?</h4>
              <p>
                Real estate development in Gowanus has been prominent since the early 2000s. Gowanus residents believed 
                that the area's pollution would deter luxury development from taking place, but this wasn't the case. 
                Real estate developers have paid several million dollars for empty and abandoned lots in the area, with 
                plans to build “hip” apartment complexes.
              </p>
              <p>
                General public interest in the cleanup of the Gowanus Canal only began when real estate development in 
                the area started and wealthier people started moving in. The cleanup, or greening, of the Gowanus Canal 
                encourages real estate developers to invest in the area, which raises housing prices even more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gowanus' median home price in 2022 is $1.79 million, compared to $630,000 in 2009. Average rent jumped 
                from $1,900 in 2009 to $3,910 in 2022.
              </p>
            <h4>Why is gentrification a problem?</h4>
            <p>
              Gentrification pushes out longtime residents, most of who are unable to benefit from the positive changes 
              to the neighborhood. It can also change the culture and character of a neighborhood completely, often 
              against residents' will.

        <h3>Works Cited</h3>
          <p>After World War II, national commercial transportation shifted from rail and ships to trucks. 
            The Gowanus Expressway connected Gowanus to the interstate highway system but destroyed local 
            homes and businesses. Pollution in the area also increased due to the number of vehicles that 
            crossed over the expressway daily. The construction of the Gowanus Expressway killed off Gowanus' 
            remaining industries, and the canal was abandoned.
