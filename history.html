          <h3>Early History</h3>
            <p>Gowanus Creek, a tidal estuary, emerged around 1,500 years ago<sup>1</sup>. A tidal estuary 
              is a partially enclosed body of saltwater. Estuaries don't have currents, aside 
              from the movement of the tides. The streams that extended from the creek were 
              surrounded by a salt marsh.
            </p>
            <p>Members of the Lenni-Lenape group of Algonquin Native Americans were the earliest 
              occupants of the land around the Gowanus Creek. They relied on the area's natural 
              resources, including fish, shellfish, and corn<sup>2</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gowanus' namesake comes from Gouwane, a Lenape chief<sup>3</sup>. The name “Gouwane” can 
              be translated to “he rests” or “the sleeper.”<sup>4</sup> 
            </p>
            <p>
              Gowanus and its surrounding areas are one of the earliest sites of outside settlement 
              in America. In 1636, two Englishmen, William Adrianse Bennet and Jacques Bentin, bought 
              land in Gowanus from Sachem Ka, a Lenni-Lenape chief<sup>5</sup>. That same year, Brooklyn's first 
              Dutch settlers made the Gowanus Bay their home<sup>6</sup>.

          <h3>The First Tide Mill</h3>
            <p>Gowanus' first tide mill (called Brouwer's Mill, Freeke's Mill, or the Old Gowanus Mill) 
              was built around 1661 by Adam Brouwer. The mill functioned with the help of millponds that 
              were dug out by slaves. Millponds controlled by a gate were necessary to produce functioning 
              mills. The millpond filled up at high tide. At low tide, the gate opened, letting water flow 
              out. This water made the millstone turn<sup>7</sup>.

          <h3>Initial Canal Plans</h3>
            <p>By the 1840s, Gowanus Creek seemed to have reached a state of obsolescence. Modern boats were 
              unable to pass since it was too shallow, and the land around the creek flooded whenever it rained<sup>8</sup>. 
              A new challenge at the time was figuring out how to stop the land from flooding. An engineer, 
              Daniel Richards, proposed digging basins but was unable to get the political and financial support 
              he needed to make this a reality. Even though he was unable to complete his proposal, his design 
              determined what the Gowanus Canal would look like in the present day<sup>9</sup>.

          <h3>Gowanus' Sewers</h3>
            <p>
              As Brooklyn's population increased in the 1850s, so did their waste and needs. Brooklynites needed 
              working sewers. Julius W. Adams, an engineer, proposed a combined sewer. Water runoff and household 
              sewage would be collected in the same pipes, which was then discarded into a body of saltwater<sup>10</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, household waste was dumped directly into the Gowanus Canal, which flooded when it rained
              and emitted an awful stench that managed to kill people<sup>11</sup>.

          <h3>Construction of the Canal and Industrialization</h3>
            <p>
              In 1849, New York State's government approved the cleaning out of Gowanus Creek to build a canal. 
              Major David Douglas of the Army Corp of Engineers was hired to design the Gowanus Canal in 1867<sup>12</sup>. 
              Construction began that same year and was completed in 1869. At the time, people were not aware 
              that the canal, an inland waterway with no outlet, would eventually have negative effects on water 
              quality and human health<sup>13</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to the newly constructed canal, the area became a key center for local, regional, and national 
              industrial growth<sup>14</sup>. The canal's waterfront became home to warehouses, coal gas manufacturing plants, 
              cement works, breweries, chemical plants, tanneries, and paper mills<sup>15</sup>. These industries dumped their 
              waste into the canal.

          <h3>The Gowanus Expressway</h3>
            <p>After World War II, national commercial transportation shifted from rail and ships to trucks. 
              The Gowanus Expressway connected Gowanus to the interstate highway system but destroyed local 
              homes and businesses<sup>16</sup>. Pollution in the area also increased due to the number of vehicles that 
              crossed over the expressway daily<sup>17</sup>. The construction of the Gowanus Expressway killed off Gowanus' 
              remaining industries, and the canal was abandoned<sup>18</sup>.
