              <p>
                The Gowanus Canal is heavily polluted with chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
                polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and heavy metals such as mercury, 
                lead, and copper.<sup>1</sup>

                            Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are byproducts of the incomplete burning of coal, gas, oil, and garbage. 
                            PAHs can be found in coal tar, crude oil, and roofing tar. Most PAH particles don't dissolve easily in water 
                            and stick to solid particles. PAHs can also be found in the air when attached to dust particles.<sup>2</sup>

                            Polychlorinated biphenyls<sup>3</sup> are mixtures of chemicals that are no longer used in the US. They have been used as 
                            coolants in lubricants in electrical equipment. PCBs do not break down easily and can remain in an area for a 
                            long period of time, as seen in Gowanus. PCBs are potential human carcinogens that can harm the endocrine, nervous, 
                            immune, and reproductive systems<sup>4</sup>.

                            Volatile organic compounds<sup>5</sup>  are synthetic compounds that are emitted by as gases by paints, office equipment, 
                            glues, cleaning supplies, and other products. People exposed to VOCs can experience nausea; damage to the liver, 
                            kidneys, or nervous system; headaches; or throat, eye, and nose irritation<sup>6</sup>.

                            Mercury, lead, and copper are all naturally occurring elements. Exposure to high levels of mercury can affect 
                            the nervous system and kidneys<sup>7</sup>. Long-term exposure to lead can cause learning, memory, and attention issues<sup>8</sup>. 
                            Ingesting large amounts of copper can lead to vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain, and in extreme cases, 
                            kidney and liver damage<sup>9</sup>.
