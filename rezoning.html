          in a year, month, week, day, hour, minute, and second.</h3>
        <img src="BezosEarnings1.png" alt="Business Insider infographic">
        <p class="infographic">They even made this infographic.</p>
        <h4>Breaking it down, Bezos made:</h4>
        <p>$78.5 billion in a year, $6.54 billion a month, $1.51 billion a week, $215 million a day,
        $9 million per hour, $150 thousand a minute, and $2.5 thousand a second.</p>
        <h4>Putting things into perspective:</h4>
        <p>Bezos' earnings per hour are 315 times Amazon workers' median annual pay of $28,466. To earn what Bezos makes in one hour, an Amazon worker earning the $15 minimum wage
        would have to work about 597,412 hours (24 hours a day for the next 68 years).</p>
        <p>In one minute, Bezos makes more than three times what the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf" target="_blank">median US worker makes in a year</a>,
          which is $45,552.</p>
        <p>Bezos' earnings per second are more than twice what the median US worker makes in one week, which is $876.</p>
        <h4>This article was last updated in January 2019, so Bezos' earnings are much higher now.</h4>

        <p>Jeff has received a base salary of $81,840 since 1998, which is still more than the median household income in the US
          (<a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-270.html" target="_blank">$68,703 in 2019</a>). In 2020, he took no bonuses, stocks, or options,
        but received about $1.6 million in additional compensation.</p>
        <p>If you <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/jeff-bezos-make-per-minute-net-worth-b1887310.html" target="_blank">break it down</a>,
          Bezos' annual income of $1.7 million turns out to be $140 thousand per month, $32 thousand per week, $4 thousand per day, $200 per hour, or
          $3.20 per minute.</p>

                    <p>At a gala for the Baby 2 Baby charity, Bezos donated $500,000. This was right
                    after someone had donated $1 million. The $500,000 Bezos donated represents 0.000001% of his net worth. The median American household
                    has a <a href="https://dqydj.com/average-median-top-net-worth-percentiles/" target="_blank">net worth of $121,411</a>.

                    <p>In April 2020, Bezos donated $100 million to Feeding America, which is the largest hunger-relief organization in the United States.
                    Bezos' contribution was the largest gift in the history of the organization.

                    $100 million was .07% of Bezos' fortune</a>, which is the equivalent to 7 cents out of a $100 bill.</p>

          <p>After World War II, national commercial transportation shifted from rail and ships to trucks. 
            The Gowanus Expressway connected Gowanus to the interstate highway system but destroyed local 
            homes and businesses. Pollution in the area also increased due to the number of vehicles that 
            crossed over the expressway daily. The construction of the Gowanus Expressway killed off Gowanus' 
            remaining industries, and the canal was abandoned.
