          <h3>What is a Superfund?</h3>
            <p>
              Established in 1980, the Superfund (also known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
              Compensation, and Liability Act) lets the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) clean up 
              contaminated sites and forces the parties responsible for the contamination to reimburse the 
              federal government for EPA-led cleanup work or perform the cleanups themselves.  
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, Superfund has the following goals:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Protect human health and the environment by cleaning up contaminated sites</li>
              <li>Make sure those responsible pay for cleanup work</li>
              <li>Involve communities in the Superfund process</li>
              <li>Return Superfund sites to productive use</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>What is a Superfund site?</h3>
            <p>A Superfund site is any location identified by the EPA as contaminated with hazardous materials. 
              These are sites in need of management and cleanup. The Gowanus Canal is a Superfund site.

          <h3>Why is the Gowanus Canal a Superfund site?</h3>
            <p>
              The Gowanus Canal was nominated by the EPA as a potential candidate for Superfund site designation 
              in 2009. The canal had scored 50/100 on the rating system for the level of toxic pollution. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The Gowanus Canal is one of the nation's most contaminated bodies of water, and canal sediment contains 
              high levels of more than a dozen contaminants. Some examples of contaminants are polycyclic aromatic 
              hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and heavy metals including mercury, lead, and copper.

        <h3>Works Cited</h3>
          <p>After World War II, national commercial transportation shifted from rail and ships to trucks. 
            The Gowanus Expressway connected Gowanus to the interstate highway system but destroyed local 
            homes and businesses. Pollution in the area also increased due to the number of vehicles that 
            crossed over the expressway daily. The construction of the Gowanus Expressway killed off Gowanus' 
            remaining industries, and the canal was abandoned.
