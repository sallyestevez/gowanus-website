          <h3>What is a Superfund?</h3>
            <p>
              Established in 1980, the Superfund (also known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
              Compensation, and Liability Act) lets the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) clean up 
              contaminated sites and forces the parties responsible for the contamination to reimburse the 
              federal government for EPA-led cleanup work or perform the cleanups themselves.<sup>1</sup>  
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, Superfund has the following goals<sup>2</sup>:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Protect human health and the environment by cleaning up contaminated sites</li>
              <li>Make sure those responsible pay for cleanup work</li>
              <li>Involve communities in the Superfund process</li>
              <li>Return Superfund sites to productive use</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>What is a Superfund site?</h3>
            <p>A Superfund site is any location identified by the EPA as contaminated with hazardous materials. 
              These are sites in need of management and cleanup.<sup>3</sup> The Gowanus Canal is a Superfund site.

          <h3>Why is the Gowanus Canal a Superfund site?</h3>
            <p>
              The Gowanus Canal was nominated by the EPA as a potential candidate for Superfund site designation 
              in 2009. The canal had scored 50/100 on the rating system for the level of toxic pollution.<sup>4</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Gowanus Canal is one of the nation's most contaminated bodies of water, and canal sediment contains 
              high levels of more than a dozen contaminants. Some examples of contaminants are polycyclic aromatic 
              hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and heavy metals including mercury, lead, and copper.<sup>5</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Contamination flows into the canal from the sewer system that carries household waste and from storm drains 
              that carry industrial pollutants and rainwater.<sup>5</sup>
            </p>

          <h3>What is being done to clean up the Gowanus Canal?</h3>
          <p>The EPA is in charge of cleaning up the Gowanus Canal, and New York State is in charge of 
            cleaning up the three former manufactured gas plants (MGPs) along the canal.<sup>5</sup></p>
          <p>The former Fulton, Citizens Gas Works, and Metropolitan Gas Light Company MGP sites are the primary sources of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons' 
            contamination of the canal. National Grid is the responsible party for the contamination.<sup>5</sup></p>
          <p>Cleanup of the canal north of the 3rd Street Bridge began in November 2020. Water was removed from the sediment, 
            treated, and pumped back into the canal.<sup>5</sup></p>
          <p>In-situ stabilization began in October 2021 and was completed in August 2022. During this process, a concrete mix was added to the native soil and the 
            contaminated sediment was removed. A cap, which will prevent contamination, will be installed in early 2023.<sup>5</sup></p>
